## 📋 Problem Statement

Urban public transportation systems face persistent equity challenges: uneven service coverage, long wait times in underserved areas, and limited visibility into how demographic changes impact access. These challenges are especially relevant in Miami-Dade County, where population density, income distribution, and transit dependency vary significantly across neighborhoods.

This project aims to design an AI-driven decision support system that identifies transit accessibility gaps, predicts emerging inequities, and evaluates the impact of potential service changes through graph-based network modeling and what-if simulations.

**Industry Focus:** Demand Forecasting · Universal Service Design · Accessibility

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Identify** current and future public transportation access gaps
2. **Predict** changes in transit demand and equity outcomes using interpretable models
3. **Model** the transit system as a graph network to capture connectivity and reachability patterns
4. **Simulate** service change scenarios using graph-based methods (frequency adjustments, route modifications, new stops)
5. **Visualize** insights through an interactive dashboard with network-aware views
6. **Support** data-driven, equity-focused transit planning decisions

## 🔬 Methodology Overview

### Sprint 1 — EDA
Data profiling, quality assessment, geographic join strategy, and exploratory visualizations to understand transit coverage vs. population density and identify access disparities.

### Sprint 2 — Predictive Modeling

**Sprint 2a** — Built a composite equity indicator framework with 7 sub-indicators from GTFS, Census (ACS), and ArcGIS isochrone data across 507 census tracts.

**Sprint 2b** — Trained a regression model to predict a Service Deficit Index from transit scheduling features. Key results:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | XGBoost (GridSearchCV-tuned, 5-fold StratifiedKFold CV) |
| **CV R²** | 0.823 ± 0.033 |
| **Test R²** | 0.789 |
| **RMSE** | 0.056 |
| **Features** | 13 (headway, frequency, weekend ratio, rail share, spatial, commute trends) |
| **Target** | Service Deficit Index — composite of 5 sub-indicators (temporal mismatch, service structure, time tax, coverage, multimodal breadth) |

Data leakage was identified and fixed: `transit_jobs_30_mean` appeared in 4/5 target sub-indicators AND as a predictor feature. Three sub-indicators were rebuilt using structural variables with zero feature/target overlap (verified programmatically). R² dropped from 0.85 (fake) to 0.82 (real).

Top predictors (SHAP): `freq_peak_am_tph` (40%), `weekend_weekday_ratio` (22%), `freq_early_tph` (7%).

Notebook: [`Sprint 2/Sprint 2b/Sprint2b_V3_LeakageFree_Modeling.ipynb`](Sprint%202/Sprint%202b/Sprint2b_V3_LeakageFree_Modeling.ipynb)

### Sprint 3 — Graph Network Modeling & Simulation
Model the transit system as a graph (stops = nodes, routes = edges). Compute network accessibility metrics (reachability, centrality, travel-time paths). Apply Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture non-linear patterns in accessibility propagation. Simulate service changes on the graph and quantify impact vs. baseline.

### Dashboard
Four core views: access gap map with demographic overlay, scenario comparison (baseline vs. proposed changes), equity indicator charts, and network connectivity visualization.

## 📝 Guiding Principles

- **Don't overcommit** — deliver what we promise, promise what we can deliver
- **AI ≠ just LLMs** — leverage regression, time series, clustering, spatial analysis, and graph neural networks
- **MVP first** — a working, interpretable pipeline beats an ambitious but unfinished system
- **Let data guide decisions** — evaluate early, pivot if needed
- **Stay curious** — ask questions and clarify assumptions continuously
